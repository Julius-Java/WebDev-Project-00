## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS media-queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Boostrap
- For styles


### What I learned

In the process of doing this project, I learned how to use the boostrap styling components and utilities, I learned about the html picture element and how it helps with displaying responsive images

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="" media="()" type="">
  <img src="">
</picture>
```
```css
@media only screen and (width:) {
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

While I learned quite a lot about responsive designs, I definitely need to perfect it as I'm still having issues with mobile responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) - This helped me with making my container divs more reponsive
