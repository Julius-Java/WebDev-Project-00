## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Boostrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#about) - Boostrap 5 Card Components

### What I learned

I learned about the boostrap card component and it's usage as it was all I had to use for this project with some custom CSS properties.

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

Responsive design is something that I would love to perfect and get better at in the future.
