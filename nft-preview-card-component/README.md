## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Boostrap Card Component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#about)


### What I learned

I learned more about the CSS flex property, and how items are aligned within a flexbox

```css
.price-section {
    margin-top: 10px;
    display: flex;
}

.eth-info, .time-left {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: row;
}
```

### Continued development
I still need to practice more with the flex property and how it manipulates element to master how to use it well

### Useful resources

- [Resource 2](https://codepen.io/mobas/pen/YRVZZy) - This codepen example helped me place align my eth and clock icon vertically with their respective paragraph tags
